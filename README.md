# Smart-Dustbin

This is a smart version of a pedestal dustbin.
Two IR sensors are used, one inside the dustbin for detecting the garbage level and another one on it's face outside the dustbin for detecting the object which will come in front of it. When it will detect object motor starts and motor will pull the cap of dustbin through a string, cap will open automatically and after sometime cap will close automatically.
